# Ball Game Documentation

This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the **Ball Game** architecture, including networking, components, game mechanics, and optimizations. Below is an overview of the different sections that explain how the system works.

# Overview

The **Ball Game** is a multiplayer game that implements real-time interactions using an optimized networking architecture. It features component management, a physics-based movement system, efficient memory handling, and game mechanics inspired by **Agar.io**.

## Key Features:
- **Custom Networking Protocol**: Uses **ASIO** for TCP communication with structured message handling.
- **SmartBuffer System**: Ensures efficient serialization and deserialization of packets.
- **Component Management**: Handles dynamic creation, deletion, and synchronization of game objects.
- **Game Loop Optimization**: Implements **fixed time-step updates** to ensure smooth and consistent behavior.
- **Multithreading**: Uses dedicated threads for networking and game updates to maximize performance.
- **Memory Management**: Includes **object pooling**, **ID recycling**, and optimized data storage.
- **AI Bots**: Implements **AI-driven bots** with dynamic movement and interaction behaviors.
- **Physics & Collision System**: Handles cell movement, merging, and consumption mechanics.
