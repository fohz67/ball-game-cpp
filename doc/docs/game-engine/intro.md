# Game Engine Overview

The Game Engine is the core framework responsible for managing game entities, rendering, components, and updates. It provides a structured way to handle game logic efficiently.

## Key Features:
- **Entity-Component System (ECS)**: Implements a modular design where each entity can hold multiple components.
- **Rendering System**: Uses SFML for drawing graphical elements efficiently.
- **Update System**: Processes logic updates for entities dynamically.
- **Component System**: Allows defining behaviors that can be attached or removed from entities.
- **Entity Management**: Handles creation, deletion, and linking of game objects.
